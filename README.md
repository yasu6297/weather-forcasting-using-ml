## Introduction

Weather forecasting is a critical application in meteorology, providing essential information for various sectors including agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. Traditional methods of weather forecasting rely heavily on statistical models and historical data, which often fall short in accuracy. With the advent of machine learning, we aim to enhance weather forecasting by leveraging predictive models trained on relevant data.

## Project Objectives

- Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict weather conditions.
- Develop a web interface to display weather predictions and animations.
- Integrate the machine learning model into a Flask application.
- Compare the performance of different machine learning models.
- Provide accurate and accessible weather forecasts for users.

## Background

Weather forecasting has evolved from traditional statistical models to advanced machine learning techniques. Conventional methods often struggle with accuracy due to the dynamic nature of weather patterns. Machine learning offers a promising solution by identifying complex patterns in weather data, improving prediction accuracy and reliability.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The dataset used for training our models includes key parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation, along with weather conditions like snow, rain, drizzle, fog, and sunny. The data was sourced from reliable meteorological databases.

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the data. This step ensured that the data was suitable for training our machine learning models.

### Model Training

We trained several machine learning models including KNN, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. Each model was evaluated based on its performance metrics to determine the most accurate predictor.

### Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This evaluation helped us identify the strengths and limitations of each model.

### Web Development Technologies

The web interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a Flask framework. The interface allows users to input weather parameters and view the predicted weather conditions along with corresponding animations.

## Results and Findings

The performance of the machine learning models was as follows:

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| KNN          | 85%      | 0.84      | 0.85   | 0.84     |
| XGBoost      | 88%      | 0.87      | 0.88   | 0.87     |
| AdaBoost     | 86%      | 0.85      | 0.86   | 0.85     |

## Conclusion

Our project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing weather forecasting accuracy. By integrating predictive models into a user-friendly web interface, we provide a valuable tool for users to access accurate weather forecasts.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional weather parameters to improve model accuracy.
- Enhance the user interface with more interactive features.
- Expand the scope to include long-term weather predictions.
